Abstract
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated their capacity to generate mathematical proofs with remarkable skill. Nevertheless, ChatGPT is not yet capable of verifying the accuracy of its proofs, which presents a major obstacle to their integration into formal mathematical studies [2,5]. In order to solve this problem, this project aims to create an interactive proof verification system that makes use of the ideas behind Vladimir Voevodsky's Homotopy type theory [4] and Per Martin-LÃ¶f's intuitionistic type theory [3]. Our suggested method builds a framework in which the correctness of proofs produced by ChatGPT may be verified using a formal proof language, Agda [9]. The system features an API that lets ChatGPT and the formal proof environment interact, ensuring that proofs are both generated and validated. This integration aims to enhance the reliability of AI-assisted mathematical proofs, and by that accelerating mathematical research and improving the overall trustworthiness of AI-generated results.

Our System's API
Our system provides an API that serves as an interface between natural language mathematical statements and formal verification processes. The API is designed to facilitate an iterative proof generation and verification cycle. Its key features encompass several interconnected components.
The API begins by accepting a mathematical statement in natural language as input. This allows users to express theorems or conjectures in a familiar, human-readable format. Upon receiving a statement, the system leverages ChatGPT to generate a proof attempt. This proof is expressed in a semi-formal language, bridging the gap between natural mathematical discourse and formal logic.
Once generated, the proof undergoes a rigorous verification process using our Agda-based formal verification system. This step ensures the logical correctness and completeness of the proof. If the verification fails, the system initiates an iterative refinement process. It provides feedback to the proof generation module, which then attempts to refine the proof. This cycle continues until a valid proof is obtained or a predefined limit is reached.
Finally, the API presents the final outcome, including the generated proof and its verification status. In cases of successful verification, it also provides a formal, machine-checkable version of the proof.
This API structure enables a symbiotic interaction between AI-driven proof generation and formal verification methods, potentially enhancing both the efficiency of proof discovery and the reliability of mathematical reasoning.
